Homework challenge using D3 visuals

% in Poverty V Healthcare - 
We can see that as the poverty level decreases so does the percent of uncovered healthcare. This showcases that the more weath a state has, the more people are covered by healthcare. 

Median Age V Healthcare - 
There seems to be a tight cluster in the median age of the data around ages 36-40 that ranges from 8% to around 18%. Younger groups tend to be covered by their parents into their 20's. In your 30's people tend to be mid-career. Depending on the work, some folks may be trade workers that may have lower healthcare coverage, as the business entities they work for could be smaller, IE 50 or fewer, and where healthcare coverage for the business can be very high due to low enrollment.

Median Income V Healthcare - 
Uninsured healthcare percentages seem to trend down with the higher median income. It seems odd that TX has a solid median income in the $50-55k range, but has the highest uninsured population. This could relate to the economy of Texas being  partially ranchers, and oil workers where jobs could pay more but provide less benefits.
